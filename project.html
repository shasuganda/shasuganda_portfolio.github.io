                        <p>The name Draw was chosen among other ideas such as stroke, lines, freehand, and spray. Draw is a brand that wants to convey the feel of easy collaboration for any projects, including art. The logo should have a hand-drawn effect as if we draw the projects by hand.
                            This logo also conveys the meaning of the company is hot and on fire in the positive way.

                            <p>Draw pages intended to have a White or light Grey background as if we start drawing from a blank White page. - Orangy Coral was chosen as the logo color because it convey the meaning of creativity and also fire as if the company is hot in the positive way. Muted Blues and Pink were chosen as complementary colors with added meaning of relax and easy working environment. The dark Grey was chosen here as the darkest contrast for font color or any other media used if needed. The design style of the brand should be clean, simple, and modern.

                                <p>I chose ROBOTO for my brand typeface and BEBAS NEUE for the complementary typeface. These were chosen because they are modern, simple, and easy to read. It symbolizes the working environment when you are using the Draw product. Easy, simple, and modern.
                                    Roboto is a neo-grotesque sans-serif typeface family developed by Google as the system font for its mobile operating system Android. Google developed the font to be "modern, yet approachable" and "emotional".
                                    Bebas Neue is a sans serif font family based on the original Bebas Neue font
                                    by Ryoichi Tsunekawa. It has grown in popularity and become something like the Helvetica.

When the wireframes were done, I was able to test them with a few people to collect some early feedback. Most of the comments were about how it may be confusing how to close the pop up thank you window, and how do you go back to home from the dashboard page, so I considered these when moving into the High fidelity wireframes.

                            are too small. I went back and revised the font and button sizes.

                                • Easier read and you feel like you’re right there next to the person
                                • More visually attractive
                                • I like this one because the text seems to flow nicely with the background image
                                • The 1/4 page design is more dynamic than splitting the screen in half
                                43% prefer the design with Grey background.
                                • Because the main image has a lot going on and the black semi opaque background creates a better color contrast for the text, making it more readable.
                                • More focused

                                • All the bottom links/texts are not as important so it’s
                                better that they recedes into the background with gray
                                ground. White ground makes all the icons and elements

                                • More minimalist and cleaner
                                • White gives more brightness color

                        <p>I was a little doubtful in the beginning of the stage because the project is too generic, too many competitors, and people are so used to with existed cloud services that they used. However, through some surveys, research, and really dig into people problems, I started to get excited about this project. The most useful research to me is the survey research and the SWOT analysis. Once I analyze the data, I realized nothing is impossible. The most challenging part of the project was writing the detailed content strategy. Without any visual, it is hard for me, especially for the the first time, to picture in my head and write in detail every process of the app. The area I enjoyed the most are coming up with ideas, branding, and final prototypes. Overall, this project is a very long project, however, I learned a lot a long the way. Some are also mentally challenging, I learned how to tackle those situations. The most rewarding feeling was when the testers were able to navigate the app easily and also really like the product.
