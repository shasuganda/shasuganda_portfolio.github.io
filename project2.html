                                <p class="section-content">Despite the burgeoning interest in the sport, there is much room for improvement in the Olympic weightlifting world. The user experience of the database website is the same as 15 years ago. It is challenging to access, if not impossible, to review the statistical data of weightlifting performances, to compare performances across athletes, and to see the latest world record per weight class.</p>

                                <p class="section-content">I am proposing a tool that the global weightlifting community can use to review data, compare performances among and across athletes, and make predictions as to the likelihood of success in upcoming competitions. This tool will take the form of a centralized database of competition results, which will allow athletes and coaches to track progress and compare performances.</p>
                                <p class="section-content">
                                The goal of this tool is to (1) promote weightlifting in the United States,  (2) support training and capacity building among athletes, and (3) improve the sport by providing athletes and coaches with evidence-based performance data in a format that is easy to understand and act on.</p>

                                <p class="section-content">This will be developed as a website and app for smartphones that will be used by athletes, coaches, club members and owners, sports analysts, and announcers at weightlifting competitions. Agile, up-to-date, and user-friendly, this website will respond to the real-time information needs of athletes, coaches, and announcers so that they can review data instantly without having to play around or adjust their layout preferences.</p>
                                <p class="section-content">I hope that this tool, Weightlifting Statistics will help athletes to improve their motivation and performance in weightlifting. Ultimately, this tool could be instrumental in building a stronger weightlifting community worldwide, and particularly in the United States.</p>

These flows will be used to support the on-boarding process, compare performances, view the top 300 athletes and their profiles, view top athletes by weight class, view rankings, and see success rates.</p>

I learned to work with groups of people who have different points of view and successfully created an app that pleased every stakeholder. I believe this is an important skill to have when working in this industry.</p>

                                <p>On a related note, after building and piloting my wireframes, I received the following helpful feedback:</p>
                                <div class="sub-para margin-top-10">
                                    <p>• Navigation: <br>
                                    In my first draft, the navigation layout was “too busy,” so I redesigned the page layout and simplified how the information was presented by unpacking the main menu into navigation, sub-navigation, and drop-down menus.</p>
                                    <p>• Table design: <br>
                                    Considering that the site is (of necessity) heavily table-based, I strived to make the table more functional, so that users could manually adjust the width of columns, hide rows that did not contain pertinent information, and export data to PDF or SVG. I also made the table more visually appealing by using a zebra striped design.</p>
                                    <p>• Graph design: <br>
                                    I redesigned the graphs to be more visually appealing. Inside the “detail view,” I included a drop-down menu so that users will be able to select which datasets they want to view.</p>

                                <p class="margin-bottom-20">In the mockup stage, I added colors, a drop-down menu, real font, wording, and graphs. During this stage, everything became more “real.” My goal was to design data tables that allowed users to scan, analyze, compare, filter, sort, and manipulate information to derive insights and tailor their training regimens accordingly. Some of the strategies I used to accomplish this involved designing interactive data tables to create a great user experience, such as: fixed headers, horizontal scrolling, resizable columns, row style zebra stripes, display density, expandable rows, quick view, sortable columns, row to details, basic filtering, filtering by columns, and searchable columns.</p>
                                <p class="margin-bottom-20">Once this work was completed, I sent out my mockups for testing some potential users.  Some of the feedback I received and the issues I resolve are:</p>

Weightlifting Red was chosen as the primary color of the logo to symbolize being strong and bold. Power Blue was chosen as the main color for the brand, as it communicates prominence, importance, and confidence, without creating a somber tone. <br> A bold grey was chosen as the darkest contrast for font color, or any other media used. Ultimately, the design style of the brand was intended to be clean, simple, and modern.</p>

                                <p class="margin-bottom-20">This project was surprisingly fun to deliver.
                                When I started the project, I was concerned that it would be challenging to execute, since I knew it would be table-heavy, with lots of statistics databases. However, after doing a lot of research on the competitors and getting feedback from potential users, I learned how to present the requisite data in a visually pleasing and easy to understand format. </p>
                                <p class="margin-bottom-20">In short, I was guided by the assumption that data is meaningless without the ability to visualize and act on it. Through my product – Weightlifting Statistics – my goal is to provide the weightlifting community with a tool they can use to not only access the data they need to improve upon their performances but also give them a superior user experience.</p>
                                <p class="margin-bottom-20">Through this project, I learned that a good user interface design should be derived from human goals and behaviors. In turn, the user interface impacts behavior, which drives further design decisions. In subtle and unconscious ways, user experience alters how humans make decisions. What is seen, where it is presented, and interactions all influence actions in subtle and complex ways. It is important to make design decisions that lead to a better user experience, and I hope to have done that through Weightlifting Statistics.</p>
